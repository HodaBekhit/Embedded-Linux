# Task 7:(u-boot)

### Objective:

##### Configure and set-up U-Boot, then load u-boot into sd fat and test it for qemu emulator.

### Steps:

**1. Download U-Boot and checkout to a specific version:**

- `git clone git@github.com:u-boot/u-boot.git`: This command clones the U-Boot Git repository to your local machine using the SSH protocol.
- `cd u-boot/`: Changes the current working directory to the newly cloned U-Boot directory.
- `git checkout v2022.07`: Checks out the specific release version (v2022.07) of U-Boot, so you are working with a known and stable version.

**2. Configure U-Boot Machine:**

`ls configs/ | grep [your machine]`: Lists the available machine configurations in the `configs/` directory. Replace `[your machine]` with the name of the machine you're interested in.

**3. Set up the Cross Compiler environment by exporting the `CROSS_COMPILE` and `ARCH` variables. **

These variables specify the path to the compiler and the target architecture.

**4. Loads the default  configuration for the ARM Vexpress Cortex A9 machine:  `make vexpress_ca9x4_defconfig`**

This sets up  U-Boot with the basic settings for this specific machine.

**5. Configure U-Boot:**

`make menuconfig`: Opens the configuration menu for U-Boot. This step allows you to customize various U-Boot settings interactively.

##### Customer requirements:

- Enable `editenv` support: Allows editing U-Boot environment variables.
- Enable `bootd` support: Supports booting from a device using the `bootd` command.
- Store environment variables inside a file called `uboot.env`.
- Unset support for Flash: Disables Flash support.
- Support FAT file system:
  - Configure the FAT interface to `mmc`: Specifies MMC as the interface for the FAT file system.
  - Configure the partition where FAT is stored to `0:1`: Specifies the storage location for the FAT file system.

**6. Copy u-boot to SD fat partation**

**7. Test U-Boot:**

Check if U-Boot and the SD card are working.

Start QEMU with an emulated SD card:

```
qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -m 128M -nographic \
-kernel u-boot/u-boot \
-sd sd.img
```

This command launches QEMU with the Vexpress Cortex A9 machine, allocates 128MB of RAM, runs in a non-graphical mode (`-nographic`), loads the U-Boot kernel (`-kernel`), and emulates an SD card (`-sd sd.img`).
